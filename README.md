# Pizza Hunt

## Description

Pizza Hunt is a progressive web application where users can post pizza recipes and participate in discussion. Pizzas are added through a form input with topping options to choose from or the option to create your own. If the user loses internet connection and hits submit the input will be cached until internet access is available. Once the pizza is added, users are able to comment and discuss the recipe. Alternatively, users can reply to each other's comments. IndexedDB and the Cache API are used to enable this application to function offline as a PWA.
